        <h4>Company Tour</h4>
        <p class="col-lg-3">
            This Spring 2019 we got the exciting opportunity to visit a local business called ProtoCAM. 
            They specialize in Industrial 3D printing and additive manufacturing. The sisters got a unique chance to be led on a tour 
            by the vice president of the company of all of the machines and ask him any questions. During the tour, we were shown through their 
            warehouse and we were able to watch how they assemble all of their parts. Everything is conducted in the same building, 
            so sisters were able to observe the assembly of products as well as the customer service and even a glimpse of some future research endeavors.
             It was a great bonding experience and we are very excited to reach out to and explore more companies in the future years!</p>
